Prompt to Continue Synthetic Data Generator Project
I am continuing work on a synthetic data generator for my FastAPI-based app. Here’s what’s already done:
I have a FastAPI project called data_generator that can:
Generate, register, and log in users (with profile update and cookie-based authentication)
Persist user data in data_generator/users.json
Generate and submit posts as authenticated users
Generate and submit comments as authenticated users
Project context:
User registration, login, and profile update endpoints are under /auth/
Posts are created via /posts/create_post
Comments are created via /posts/create_comment
The backend expects tokens in the users_access_token cookie
User, post, and comment schemas match the backend’s Pydantic models
Code structure:
User models and generators: app/models/user.py
Post models and generators: app/models/post.py
Comment models and generators: app/models/comment.py
User registration/login/profile update: app/api/registration.py
Post submission: app/api/posting.py
Comment submission: app/api/commenting.py
User persistence: app/utils/user_store.py
What I want to do next:
[Describe your next goal here, e.g., “Automate user activity (posting and commenting in a loop),” “Simulate multiple users,” “Add error handling/reporting,” etc.]
Please review my setup and help me continue from here. If you need to see any code, let me know which file.
