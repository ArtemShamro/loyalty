# Overview


I want to develop 
[Simulate user behaviour of usge the main app. Generate user data, register, login, make posts and commnts using the main app handlers.]

# Core Features  
[List and describe the main features of your product. For each feature, include:
- Generate new user data
- Register users using REST API of main service
- Generate new posts and post them using API service
- Generate comments for posts and post them using API Service of main app]

# User Experience  
[Describe the user journey and experience. Include:
- Accept parameters:
    - count of users to generate and register
    - what they should do: comment or make posts
    - how many posts they should make and about what topic
    - how many comments thay should make
- No user interface, just handlers for rest api (fast api application)]
</context>
<PRD>
# Technical Architecture  
[Outline the technical implementation details:
- System components: FastApi aplication
- Data models: ML model for data generation
- Infrastructure requirements: should be part of main app infrastructure
]

# Development Roadmap  
[Break down the development process into phases:
- MVP requirements
- Future enhancements
- Do not think about timelines whatsoever -- all that matters is scope and detailing exactly what needs to be build in each phase so it can later be cut up into tasks]

# Logical Dependency Chain
[Define the logical order of development:
- Firstly develop API handlers and parameters for generation
- Develop communication with main app for register users, make posts and comments
- Connect ML model for generation
]

# Appendix  
[My main app located in root directory of this project, it contains several services, but all incoming REST API requests process by proxy server, that contains following routes:
/api route that provide handlers for register users, login etc.
/posts route that response for actions with posts and comments
all handlers described in the files of proxy service /proxy/]
